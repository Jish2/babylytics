<h2 style="text-align:center">What is Babyltics?</h2>

Babylytics uses Tensorflow trained on data from over 2,000 fetuses to predict the health of a fetus. Simply upload fetal data to our site our trained model returns the percent confidence of the fetus's health. Babylytics was created with the intent of using a deep-learning approach to support doctors in determining a fetus‚Äô health.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Why Babyltics?</h2>

In late April of 2022, we attended [HackFTW](https://hackftw.net/). We were prompted to create something that would aim to achieve one of the UN‚Äôs goals. After research, we discovered that every year, 21,000 infants die, pointing us toward the UN‚Äôs third goal: Good Health and Well-being. Our team was inspired by this metric, hoping to prevent infant mortality one step at a time.
